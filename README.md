## Features

* Dynamic arrays, strings, dictionaries, sets and streams
* Arbitrary-precision rational arithmetic
* Real and complex numbers
* Multicontext execution (multithreading), synchronization primitives, blocking
  queues
* Regular expressions _(under construction)_
* REPL
* Support for Java scripting API (JSRÂ 223)

## Examples

Here are three implementations of the procedure that calculates the factorial:
recursive, iterative and stream-based.

```
/factorial
{
    dup iszero
    { pop 1 }
    { dup 1 sub factorial mul }
    ifelse
}
bind def
```

```
/factorial
{
    1 2 1 4 -1 roll { mul } for
}
bind def
```

```
/factorial
{
    1 1 3 -1 roll range 1 { mul } reduce
}
bind def
```

Calculating factorial of 50:

```
50 factorial tostring say
```
